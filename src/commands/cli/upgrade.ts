/**
 * sentry cli upgrade
 *
 * Self-update the Sentry CLI to the latest or a specific version.
 * After upgrading, spawns the NEW binary with `cli setup` to update
 * completions, agent skills, and record installation metadata.
 *
 * Supports two release channels:
 * - stable (default): tracks the latest GitHub release
 * - nightly: tracks the rolling nightly prerelease built from main
 *
 * The channel can be set via --channel or by passing "nightly"/"stable"
 * as the version argument. The choice is persisted in the local database
 * so that subsequent bare `sentry cli upgrade` calls use the same channel.
